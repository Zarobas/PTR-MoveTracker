The macro is made for Forge and used with PTR.
Created with ChatGPT, so there may be a lot of spaghetti code, but it works.

1. Click on the Token or open the Sheet.
2. Press the macro.
3. Drag and drop moves into the dropzone.
4. Set the Frequency.

Counter: Set a counter for uses in the scene or daily moves. It needs to be refreshed manually.

EXH: Made for EOT (Every Other Turn) moves. Appears red when clicked and stays red until another button is clicked.

USE: Made for At-Will (Every Turn) moves. Works the same as EXH but appears green.
